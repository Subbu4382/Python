# Introduction to SQLite
sqlite is a c-language library that implements a self-contained,serverless,zero-configuration,tranctional sql database engine
self-containes : requires minimal support from the operating system or external library
zero-configuration : server less architecture , no installation required
maintenance : its just a single file so, a normal copy-paste is enough to create a back-up


limitations : database size is restricted to 2GB in most cases
              SQLite used to handle low to medium traffic(HTTP Request)
              400 k to 500k HTTP requests per day
